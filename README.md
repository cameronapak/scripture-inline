# Scripture Inline

Drop-in Scripture for any web page: show a passage, pick a passage, or bring every Bible reference to life.

Scripture Inline has three parts:

- **Bible references.** A script finds references such as "John 3:16" or "Rom 8:28-30" in your page's text. It makes each one open a Scripture card or link to [route.bible](https://route.bible).
- **`<si-passage>`** shows a Bible passage.
- **`<si-passage-input>`** is a form field that lets readers pick a passage, with autocomplete for books, chapters, and verses.

Bible text comes from the [YouVersion Platform](https://developers.youversion.com/). Scripture Inline is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by YouVersion or Life.Church.

> Scripture Inline is in preview. Expect changes before 1.0.

## Getting started

### 1. Get an app key

Cards and passages need a free YouVersion Platform app key. Sign up at [platform.youversion.com](https://platform.youversion.com/), then create an app and copy its app key. The key is public, so you can put it in page markup. Link mode works without a key.

### 2. Add the script

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@faith-tools/scripture-inline@0.1.1/dist/scripture-inline.js"
  data-yvp-public-app-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_APP_KEY"
></script>
```

The script registers both components and turns the Bible references on the page into Scripture cards. Its app key is the default for every `<si-passage>` on the page.

Attributes that start with `yvp-` are YouVersion Platform settings. Passage IDs such as `JHN.3.16` use the [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) book codes, so they have no prefix.

## Bible references

The script looks for references in the page's text, including abbreviations. It skips text in `code`, `pre`, links, form fields, and anything marked `data-scripture-inline-ignore`. Links lay out exactly like the text they replace, so lines never reflow.

| Script tag / JavaScript | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-yvp-public-app-key` / `yvpPublicAppKey` | None | Your public app key. Required for `card`. |
| `data-mode` / `mode` | `card` | `card` opens a Scripture card. `link` links to route.bible. The script tag uses `link` when it has no key. |
| `data-trigger` / `trigger` | `click` | `hover` also opens cards on mouse hover. |
| `data-yvp-bible-version-id` / `yvpBibleVersionId` | `3034` | The Bible version for cards. 3034 is the Berean Standard Bible (BSB). |
| `data-reference` / `reference` | `heading` | The card's reference layout, as on `<si-passage>`. |
| `root` | Whole page | The element to look for references in. JavaScript only. |

## `<si-passage>`

```html
<si-passage yvp-bible-version-id="3034" passage-id="JHN.3.16"></si-passage>
```

| Attribute | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yvp-bible-version-id` | None | The Bible version, such as `3034` for the BSB. Required. |
| `passage-id` | None | A USFM passage such as `ROM.8.28-30`, or a whole chapter such as `ROM.8`. Required. |
| `reference` | `heading` | Where the reference shows: `heading`, `citation`, `quote`, or `none`. |
| `verse-numbers` | Shown | `hide` removes verse numbers. |
| `headings` | Shown | `hide` removes section headings. |
| `red-letter` | On | `off` shows the words of Jesus in the text color. |
| `theme` | `light` | `light`, `dark`, or `auto` to follow the system. |
| `direction` | From the passage | `ltr` or `rtl`. |
| `yvp-public-app-key` | The script tag's key | Overrides the page-wide app key. |
| `yvp-api-host` | YouVersion's API | Another API host, for testing. |

Attributes choose what the passage shows. CSS properties choose how it looks, so one rule can style every passage on a page:

```css
si-passage {
  --scripture-font-size: 18px;
  --scripture-max-width: 40rem;
}
```

| CSS property | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--scripture-font-size` | `20px` | The Bible text size. The reference line scales with it. |
| `--scripture-line-height` | `1.625` | Line height of the Bible text. |
| `--scripture-font-family` | Untitled Serif | Font of the Bible text. |
| `--scripture-max-width` | `32rem` | Line length of the text, reference, and copyright. |

| Event | Detail | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripture-load` | `passageId`, `yvpBibleVersionId`, `yvpBibleVersion` | The passage is on screen. |
| `scripture-error` | The error | The passage could not load. |

## `<si-passage-input>`

```html
<form>
  <label for="passage">Passage</label>
  <si-passage-input id="passage" name="passage" placeholder="Romans 8 or John 3:16"></si-passage-input>
</form>
```

Readers can type a book, chapter, or verse, including typos like "Roman 8". The field suggests matches and stores a USFM ID such as `ROM.8` or `ROM.8.1`. When the field is focused and empty, it lists every book.

| Attribute | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | Empty | The starting passage, as a USFM ID such as `JHN.3.16`. |
| `name` | None | The form field name. The form submits the passage ID. |
| `placeholder` | None | Hint text in the empty field. |
| `book-order` | `canonical` | `canonical` lists books Genesis to Revelation. `alphabetical` lists them A to Z. |
| `disabled` | Off | Turns the field off. |

| Event | Detail | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `change` | `passageId`, `label` | The reader picks a passage or clears the field. `passageId` is empty when cleared. |

To show the picked passage:

```js
const input = document.querySelector("si-passage-input");
const passage = document.querySelector("si-passage");
input.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  if (event.detail.passageId) passage.setAttribute("passage-id", event.detail.passageId);
});
```

## JavaScript

With a bundler, install the package and call the same functions the script tag uses:

```sh
npm install @faith-tools/scripture-inline
```

```js
import { defineScripturePassage, definePassageInput, scriptureInline } from "@faith-tools/scripture-inline";

defineScripturePassage({ yvpPublicAppKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_APP_KEY" });
definePassageInput();
scriptureInline({ yvpPublicAppKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_APP_KEY", root: document.querySelector("article") });
```

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scriptureInline(options)` | Finds and links references. Takes the [Bible references](#bible-references) options and returns `{ links, stop }`. `stop()` restores the plain text. |
| `defineScripturePassage({ yvpPublicAppKey })` | Registers `<si-passage>`. The optional `yvpPublicAppKey` is the default for every passage. |
| `definePassageInput()` | Registers `<si-passage-input>`. |
| `findReferences(text)` | Returns the references in a string, without touching the page. |

## Development

You need Node and pnpm. Put your app key in `.env.local`:

```sh
VITE_YVP_APP_KEY=your-public-app-key
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Installs dependencies. |
| `pnpm dev` | Serves the docs and demo page at `http://localhost:5173`. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Checks types. |
| `pnpm test` | Runs the tests. |
| `pnpm build` | Builds the browser script, the ES module, and the type declarations into `dist`. |
| `pnpm check` | Runs the typecheck, tests, and build, as CI does. |

### Releasing

Releases use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Run `pnpm changeset` in a PR to describe the change and pick a version bump. When the PR merges, a "Version Packages" PR opens. Merging that PR publishes the new version to npm.
